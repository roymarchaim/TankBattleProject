Notes About Our Project:

* A weakened wall (hit by a shell-*) is presented on screen by '='.
 
* when a tank reaches to a point where it cannot move due to a blocking wall, the player has to try to press other keys in order to make the tank move (the keys that make the tank being blocked by a wall are ignored).

* If a tank hits a wall in reverse (or in stay mode)- it stops in its place until a valid key is pressed and you will move forward by default. 

* The tanks move only on even indices iterations of the main while game loop in order to make the shells (*) move faster than the tanks and create a tank recoil illusion

Bonus Points Requirement:

* Pop Up messages via MessageBox indicating game status for game pausing, win, loss and tie.
